## Code Review

- [ ] The code is well-designed.
- [ ] The functionality is good for the users of the code.
- [ ] Any UI changes are sensible and look good.
- [ ] Any parallel programming is done safely.
- [ ] The code isn’t more complex than it needs to be.
- [ ] The developer isn’t implementing things they might need in the future but don’t know they need now.
- [ ] Code has appropriate unit tests.
- [ ] Tests are well-designed.
- [ ] The developer used clear names for everything.
- [ ] Comments are clear and useful, and mostly explain why instead of what.
- [ ] Code is appropriately documented (generally in g3doc).
- [ ] The code conforms to our style guides.


## How to

1. Know what the change is trying to achieve. Does this change need to be made or could existing functionality achieve this goal. Eg:// new page vs content editable page
2. Look at the most important part of the change first. Is it well-designed overall?
3. Does it have appropriate coverage to prevent issues in new modifications? 
4. Does it make the code base a little bit better?



## Code of conduct
1. Be kind
2. Explain ypur reasoning
3. Encourage developers to simplify code or add code comments instead of just explaining the code/complexity to you.
4. Highlight and complement good work
5. Respond within 1 day of review comments
6. Reviews are important, do them without interupting yourself to keep velocity high


## Handing pushback
1. Are they right? (they're closer to the code and understand the problem better)
2. Eplain why you're right more, provide examples and clear up confusion
3. Don't stop a review because of style
4. Don't approve changes where fixes are done later
5. Dont't approve changes because is causes an upset
